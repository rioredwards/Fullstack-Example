# How to start the application

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Frontend folder and start Live Server in the index.html file
3. In your terminal, run `cd backend`
4. Then run `npm install`
5. Rename the .env.example file to .env
6. In the .env file, replace `your_db_username` and `your_db_password` with the actual username and password of your database
7. Run `npm start` to start the server
8. Done! ðŸŽ‰

Note: To verify it's working, try using the frontend application in your browser. There should already be todos loaded from the database, and you should be able to add new todos.
