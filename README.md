# How to start the application

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Frontend folder and start Live Server in the index.html file
3. In your terminal, run `cd backend`
4. Then run `npm install`
5. Rename the .env.example file to .env
6. In the .env file, replace `your_db_username` and `your_db_password` with the actual username and password of your database (Ask me, Rio, for my credentials if you just wanna use my database)
7. Run `npm start` to start the server
8. Done! ðŸŽ‰

Note: To verify it's working, try using the frontend application in your browser. You will probably need to reload the window, then you should see todos displaying from the database. You should be able to add new todos.
